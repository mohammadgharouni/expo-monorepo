## üöÄ How to use it

You can use and modify this repository however you want. If you want to use EAS to build your app, you'll need to create an [Expo access token](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/settings/access-tokens) and set it as `EXPO_TOKEN` GitHub actions secret.

To run the repository locally, run these two commands:

- `$ pnpm install` - This installs all required Node libraries using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).
- `$ pnpm dev` - Starts the development servers for all **apps**.
